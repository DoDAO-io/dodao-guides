## About DoDAO
DoDAO is an educational hub and offers onboarding platform for DAOs. 

We believe that DAOs will play a fundamental role in transforming the way in which organizations operate. We want to be a part of the DAO movement by providing educational content and developing an onboarding platform to help DAOs onboard their members.  

DAOs or Blockchain projects operate in an open way i.e. open discussion forums, chats, meetings, code etc. Although each of the discord servers of the crypto projects has more than 2-5k members, only a handful of the members actively participate or contribute. The reason is that the new members are simply not aware of how to get started, where to contribute, what reward to expect etc. This leads to the loss of opportunity for both the DAOs/crypto projects and the members who wanted to join the projects.

We believe, the gap can be bridged by providing interactive and to-the-point guided content to new members along with some quizzes. For example, there can be different guides for content writers, developers, and marketers. Here is an example of such a guide meant for content writers willing to join us.

## Educational Hub

## DoDAO Educational Hub
https://www.dodao.io/ - For DoDAO Educational Hub!, Our goal is to become the foremost resource for everything related to DAOs. We will be providing educational content in the form of articles and videos. We hope that this wiki will help people learn about DAOs and how they can be used to create value. The articles will be divided into four below categories

1) DAO Frameworks - DAO Frameworks are sets of tools that allow DAOs to improve their collaboration, governance, and operations. The frameworks provide templates and best practices that help DAOs to get up and running quickly while still maintaining a high degree of standardization.
2) DAOs - We talk about the mission, governance, current state, tokenomics etc of the DAOs
3) Bogs - There are general informative articles
4) News - The DAO space is constantly evolving with new projects and announcements. In this section, we provide an overview of the latest news in the DAO space

https://eth.dodao.io/ - DoDAOs onboarding platform enables DAOs to create interactive onboarding content in the form of guides. Our guides are far better than normal documentation in a number of ways
1) Guides are to-the-point and are meant to onboard users for a specific role or task.
2) Information is presented to the user in a piece-by-piece way i.e. in steps.
3) Guides have evaluation steps that force the user to go through the contents carefully
4) Guide completion is tracked i.e. we know the user's wallet address, completion date, and score.
5) Guides can capture user inputs like their name, email, discord username etc.
6) We can get guide completion updates in Discord 
7) This data can be queried to apply smart logic like: gating of discord channels, gating of product boards, and proposal voting.

You yourself can see these advantages by giving our guides a try
