      "content": "### Copy-Paste\nIt is a violation of copyright law to copy text or explanations and use them as your own. If you are caught copy-pasting the content, you will be removed from the team. In some cases we might have to capture the facts and in those case we need to add a link to the original article etc.\n\nWriting can be quite daunting, but we have tools that can reduce 50% of the work for you. You can use an english rewrite tool like https://app.peppertype.ai/create/content-rewriter to rewrite the content. We discuss about this in detail in the next step of the guide.\n\n### Communicate Availability\nWe understand that DoDAO may only be a side project for you and that there can be other more pressing commitments. But if you pick a task, please make sure you complete it within 3-5 days.\n\nIt's perfectly understandable if you need to take a long break for exams or vacations - just make sure you let your team know in advance so there isn't any confusion or inconvenience later on.\n\n### Quality\nQuality is always our top priority because we would rather not do something at all than deliver content that is of poor quality or is sub-standard.\n\nA single instance of low-quality content can damage the reputation of the entire team, so it's important to be vigilant about the standards of the content we produce.\n\n### Task is Tracked\nAll the tasks in DoDAO are paid. So, if you're working on a task, make sure it's present on the project board and that you're clear about the amount you'll be paid for that deliverable. That way, you can avoid any confusion or misunderstanding about payments.\n\n### Payments\nWe make payments on Ethereum mainnet, and we prefer to use USDC. We have to pay a gas fee for every transfer, which can range from $5 to $15. To avoid wasting funds on gas fees, we wait until our teammates have completed at least $200 worth of work before we make a payment.\n\nWhenever you receive payments from us in cryptocurrency, we recommend that you transfer the funds to your bank account as soon as possible. Depending on which country you're in, the process for doing this can vary. If you need more information about how to go about this, reach out to the team and we'll be happy to help.",

      "content": "### Content Rewrite\nAs a smart tech-team, we want to spend most of our time understanding the topics rather than writing in English. So a smart way to write an article or guide is to read and extract the most important information related to the topic and then try to write about it using some content writing tools. \n\nYou can use an english rewrite tool like [https://app.peppertype.ai/create/content-rewriter](https://app.peppertype.ai/create/content-rewriter) to rewrite the content for you. These tools are 50-70% accurate, so you will have to pay attention on what this tool outputs.      \n\nAfter a strong understanding of the chosen topic, you will be able to write a guide or an article using these tools within 2-4 hours.\n\nWe have a paid subscription of PepperType and can give you free access if you want.\n\n### Pick Easy Tasks\nWe always need more content, and sometimes the topics can be difficult or outside of your area of expertise. \n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, please let us know and we will assign you a different topic. This will help save you and the reviewer time, and more importantly maintain a good working relationship.\n\n### Referral Rewards\nWe're on the lookout for more fabulous interns and content writers! If you know anyone who might be a good fit, be sure to let us know so we can check them out. \n\nAs a little incentive, we're offering monetary rewards to anyone who refers a quality candidate that ultimately contribute to the project. \n\nSo if you think you know someone we should meet, please don't hesitate to put them in touch with us or pass along their information. For more information, just ask a member of our team.",
