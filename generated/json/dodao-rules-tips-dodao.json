      "content": "### Content Rewrite\nAs a smart tech-team, we want to spend most of our time understanding the topics rather than writing in English. So a smart way to write an article or guide is to read and extract the most important information related to the topic and then try to write about it using some content writing tools. \n\nYou can use an english rewrite tool like [https://app.peppertype.ai/create/content-rewriter](https://app.peppertype.ai/create/content-rewriter) to rewrite the content for you. These tools are 50-70% accurate, so you will have to pay attention on what this tool outputs.      \n\nAfter a strong understanding of the chosen topic, you will be able to write a guide or an article using these tools within 2-4 hours.\n\nWe have a paid subscription of PepperType and can give you free access if you want.\n\n### Pick Easy Tasks\nWe always need more content, and sometimes the topics can be difficult or outside of your area of expertise. \n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, please let us know and we will assign you a different topic. This will help save you and the reviewer time, and more importantly maintain a good working relationship.\n\n### Referral Rewards\nWe're on the lookout for more fabulous interns and content writers! If you know anyone who might be a good fit, be sure to let us know so we can check them out. \n\nAs a little incentive, we're offering monetary rewards to anyone who refers a quality candidate that ultimately contribute to the project. \n\nSo if you think you know someone we should meet, please don't hesitate to put them in touch with us or pass along their information. For more information, just ask a member of our team.",
