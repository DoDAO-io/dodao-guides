The reason we use YAML format is because it is easier to write a YAML as compared to JSON. Also, YAML provides easy way to work with multi-line strings.\n\nWith-in the course YAML files, we have content field for step and stepItems. This field can contain multi-line strings. The contents of these multi-line strings can be in Markdown format.\n\nIf you are willing to contribute, it is very important that you understand the basics of YAML and Markdown format\n\n## Learn YAML\nYou can go through these tutorials or watch any of the youtube videos on YAML\n\n[https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started)\n\n[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/index.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/index.htm)\n\n## Learn Markdown\nYou can go through these articles or watch any of the youtube videos on Markdown\n\n[https://www.markdowntutorial.com/](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)\n\n## Setup\nUse a proper IDE that can validate yaml file and also that shows markdown in view format.\n",
