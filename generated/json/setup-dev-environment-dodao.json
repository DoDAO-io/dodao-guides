Articles\n\n### Contributing to guides and courses\nThe best way to contribute towards creating or updating guides or courses is by editing the files in git repositories and then creating a pull request for reviews. This way, we can review the content that you write and make sure it meets our standards.\n\n### Pre-requisites\n#### Learn YAML\nYou can go through these tutorials or watch any of the youtube videos on YAML\n\n[https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started)\n\n[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/index.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/index.htm)\n\n#### Learn Markdown\nYou can go through these articles or watch any of the youtube videos on Markdown\n\n[https://www.markdowntutorial.com/](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)\n\n#### Learn Git\nYou can go through this tutorial or watch any of the youtube videos on YAML\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw",

All the content to be added or updated needs to be written in `yaml` files i.e. under `src` directory\n2. All the files under `generated` directory are the files generated from the yaml files after we run `yarn test`\n3. Files under `generated/json` are used by the app to render guides in the browser\n4. Files under `generated/markdown` can be used by you to check the formatting of the content\n5. Before you create a pull request, make sure to run `yarn test` and also checkin the generated files.\n",

      "content": "To edit the Yaml files use a code editor. We recommend https://code.visualstudio.com\n\nInstall the following plugins in your code editor\n1. **Git** - This plugin can make it easy for you to see which files you have modified and allows you to checkin the code from the code editor itself.\n2. **Yaml** - Yaml files follow a particular format and the plugin highlights the code in different colours making it very easy for you to add or update the content.\n3. **Markdown** - We process the yaml files and then generate the metadata in markdown format. By installing markdown viewer, you can check the formatting of the markdown files. For guides and courses both, we generate markdown files, which you can open in the markdown viewer and check the formatting\n\n",

Setup ssh keys in github as explained here https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account.  This will allow you to commit and push your commits\n2. Make sure you have access to the main repository to be able to create a new branch and commit to it. If you don't have access, contact a team member.\n3. Make sure you run `yarn test` and also commit the generated files\n4. After you create a pull request in github, make sure there are no merge conflicts",
