      ### Copy-Paste

      It is a violation of copyright law to copy text or explanations and use
      them as your own. If you are caught plagiarizing, you will be removed from
      the team.


      You can use an english rewrite tool like
      https://app.peppertype.ai/create/content-rewriter to rewrite the content
      for you.


      ### Communicate Availability

      We understand that DoDAO may only be a side project for you and that there
      can be other more pressing commitments. But if you pick a task, please
      make sure you complete it within 3-5 days.


      It's perfectly understandable if you need to take a long break for exams
      or vacations - just make sure you let your team know in advance so there
      isn't any confusion or inconvenience later on.


      ### Quality

      Quality is always our top priority because we would rather not do
      something at all than deliver content that is of poor quality or is
      sub-standard.


      A single instance of low-quality content can damage the reputation of the
      entire team, so it's important to be vigilant about the standards of the
      content we produce.


      ### Task is Tracked

      All the tasks in DoDAO are paid. So, if you're working on a task, make
      sure it's present on the project board and that you're clear about the
      amount you'll be paid for that deliverable. That way, you can avoid any
      confusion or misunderstanding about payments.


      ### Payments

      We make payments on Ethereum mainnet, and we prefer to use USDC. We have
      to pay a gas fee for every transfer, which can range from $5 to $15. To
      avoid wasting funds on gas fees, we wait until our teammates have
      completed at least $200 worth of work before we make a payment.


      Whenever you receive payments from us in cryptocurrency, we recommend that
      you transfer the funds to your bank account as soon as possible. Depending
      on which country you're in, the process for doing this can vary. If you
      need more information about how to go about this, reach out to the team
      and we'll be happy to help.

      ### Content Rewrite

      As a smart tech-team, we want to spend most of our time understanding the
      topics rather than writing in English. So a smart way to write an article
      or guide is to read and extract the most important information related to
      the topic and then try to write about it using some content writing
      tools. 


      You can use an english rewrite tool like
      [https://app.peppertype.ai/create/content-rewriter](https://app.peppertype.ai/create/content-rewriter)
      to rewrite the content for you. These tools are 50-70% accurate, so you
      will have to pay attention on what this tool outputs.      


      After a strong understanding of the chosen topic, you will be able to
      write a guide or an article using these tools within 2-4 hours.


      We have a paid subscription of PepperType and can give you free access if
      you want.


      ### Pick Easy Tasks

      We always need more content, and sometimes the topics can be difficult or
      outside of your area of expertise. 


      If you find yourself in this situation, please let us know and we will
      assign you a different topic. This will help save you and the reviewer
      time, and more importantly maintain a good working relationship.


      ### Referral Rewards

      We're on the lookout for more fabulous interns and content writers! If you
      know anyone who might be a good fit, be sure to let us know so we can
      check them out. 


      As a little incentive, we're offering monetary rewards to anyone who
      refers a quality candidate that ultimately contribute to the project. 


      So if you think you know someone we should meet, please don't hesitate to
      put them in touch with us or pass along their information. For more
      information, just ask a member of our team.
