      ### Type of Content

      In DoDAO we primarily write three type of contents

      1. Guides

      2. Courses

      3. Articles


      ### Contributing to guides and courses

      The best way to contribute towards creating or updating guides or courses
      is by editing the files in git repositories and then creating a pull
      request for reviews. This way, we can review the content that you write
      and make sure it meets our standards.


      ### Pre-requisites

      #### Learn YAML

      Any of the guides repositories like
      [https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-academy-guides](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-academy-guides)
      have the following structure.

      ```

      |--- LICENSE

      |--- README.md

      |--- aa.txt

      |--- generated

      |     |--- json

      |     |     |--- guide-file-1.json

      |     |     |--- guide-file-2.json

      |     |     |--- guides.json

      |     |--- markdown

      |         |--- guide-file-1.md

      |         |--- guide-file-1.md

      |--- package.json

      |--- src

      |     |--- guide-file-1.yaml

      |     |--- guide-file-2.yaml

      |     |--- guides-footer.md

      |     |--- guides-header.md

      |     |--- guides.yaml

      |--- yarn.lock


      ```

      Important things to keep in mind are 

      1. All the content to be added or updated needs to be written in `yaml`
      files i.e. under `src` directory

      2. All the files under `generated` directory are the files generated from
      the yaml files after we run `yarn test`

      3. Files under `generated/json` are used by the app to render guides in
      the browser

      4. Files under `generated/markdown` can be used by you to check the
      formatting of the content

      5. Before you create a pull request, make sure to run `yarn test` and also
      checkin the generated files.

      To edit the Yaml files use a code editor. We recommend
      https://code.visualstudio.com


      Install the following plugins in your code editor

      1. **Git** - This plugin can make it easy for you to see which files you
      have modified and allows you to checkin the code from the code editor
      itself.

      2. **Yaml** - Yaml files follow a particular format and the plugin
      highlights the code in different colours making it very easy for you to
      add or update the content.

      3. **Markdown** - We process the yaml files and then generate the metadata
      in markdown format. By installing markdown viewer, you can check the
      formatting of the markdown files. For guides and courses both, we generate
      markdown files, which you can open in the markdown viewer and check the
      formatting
