      We have two ways of writing the guides
      1. Through the UI
      2. Through Git

      Git options provides a couple of benefits
      1. Review's can be done via PRs
      2. People across the project can for the repository and contribute
      3. Content is backed-up
      4. Content is Open Source and can be used by everyone

      When adding a new guide you will have to add a new YAML file in `src` directory.
      
      We then need to add the entry of that file in `guides.yaml` file. 
      
      e.g. see this repository [https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-aave-guides](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-aave-guides)
      
      We add guide files in yaml format. The reason we use YAML format is because it is easier to write a YAML as compared to JSON. Also, YAML provides easy way to work with multi-line strings.
      
      With-in the course YAML files, we have content field for step and stepItems. This field can contain multi-line strings. The contents of these multi-line strings can be in Markdown format.
      
      If you are willing to contribute, it is very important that you understand the basics of YAML and Markdown format

      ## Learn YAML
      You can go through these tutorials or watch any of the youtube videos on YAML

      ## Setup
      Use a proper IDE that can validate yaml file and also that shows markdown in view format.
